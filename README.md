# Counter Component with State Management

## **Overview**
This is a simple React application that demonstrates the use of state management with the `useState` hook. The Counter component implements various ways to update state, showcasing React's state batching and asynchronous behavior.

## **Features**
- **Increment Button**: Increases the count by 1.
- **Increment After Delay Button**: Increases the count by 1 after a 2-second delay.
- **Increment Twice Button**: Attempts to increase the count by 2 immediately (demonstrates state batching).
- **Correct Increment Twice Button**: Correctly increments the count by 2 using the state updater function.

## **Installation & Setup**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/luwamhabtu07/counter-app.git
